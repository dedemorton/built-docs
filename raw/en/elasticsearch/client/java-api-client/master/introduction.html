<p>This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for the official Java API Client for Elasticsearch. The client
provides strongly typed requests and responses for all Elasticsearch APIs.</p>
<h3><a id="_features"></a>Features<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-java/edit/main/docs/introduction.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Strongly typed requests and responses for all Elasticsearch APIs.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Blocking and asynchronous versions of all APIs.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Use of fluent builders and functional patterns to allow writing concise yet
readable code when creating complex nested structures.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Seamless integration of application classes by using an object mapper such as
Jackson or any JSON-B implementation.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Delegates protocol handling to an http client such as the <a class="xref" href="java-rest-low.html" title="Java Low Level REST Client">Java Low Level REST Client</a>
that takes care of all transport-level concerns: HTTP connection pooling,
retries, node discovery, and so on.

<h3><a id="_beta_status"></a>Beta status<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-java/edit/main/docs/introduction.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The Java API Client is a new product and is still in beta. What this means in
concrete terms:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Although the general structure will not change, some renaming may happen to
improve ease of use.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Some APIs may not be implemented yet. The code for APIs is generated from the
<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch API specification</a>
where complete coverage is targeted for the GA release of the Java client.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Some complex API data types are not yet fully supported. This revolves mostly
around union types where the JSON API accepts many different shapes for some
property. These types are currently represented as raw <code class="literal">JsonValue</code> objects.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Some built-in types like dates are represented as primitive strings.
Additional support for standard JDK types will be added for the GA release.
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="_compatibility"></a>Compatibility<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-java/edit/main/docs/introduction.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The main branch targets the next major release (8.0), the 7.x branch targets the
next minor release for the 7.x series. Support is still incomplete as the API
code is generated from the Elasticsearch Specification that is also still a work in
progress.</p>
<p>The Elasticsearch Java client is forward compatible; meaning that the client supports
communicating with greater or equal minor versions of Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch language
clients are only backwards compatible with default distributions and without
guarantees made.</p>
